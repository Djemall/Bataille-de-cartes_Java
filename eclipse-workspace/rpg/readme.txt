#PROJECT RPG JAVA

This small project in java was carried out in order to select a type of character, his weapon, and to allow him to survey a map where 
he can cross obstacles or monsters, and attack them with his weapon. 

If the player reaches the end of the card, he wins the game.


Having failed to create a physical map, here I set up an imaginary map, with a combination of "winning" moves.


This is an alternative.

Despite my difficulties in java, I tried to circumvent the problem to achieve the desired essential.





"Les obstacles ne doivent pas t'arrêter. Si tu rencontres un mur, ne te retourne pas et n'abandonne pas. 
Tu dois comprendre comment escalader, traverser ou contourner le problème."
- Michael Jordan

Peace and progress.
